# Flutter App Performance Best Practices

Optimizing the performance of a Flutter app is crucial for ensuring a smooth, responsive user experience. Here are all the key practices developers should follow to enhance Flutter app performance:

---

## 1. **Use Const Constructors Wherever Possible**

* Reuse widgets with `const` keyword to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

```dart
const Text('Hello');
```

## 2. **Avoid Rebuilding Entire Widget Trees**

* Split large widgets into smaller ones.
* Use `ValueListenableBuilder`, `Selector`, or `BlocBuilder` for controlled rebuilding.

## 3. **Use ListView\.builder, GridView\.builder for Long Lists**

* These are lazily built and only render visible items.

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(title: Text(items[index])),
);
```

## 4. **Cache Images Efficiently**

* Use `cached_network_image` package to reduce image load times.

## 5. **Minimize Overdraw**

* Avoid placing multiple layers over each other without transparency.
* Prefer `Opacity(opacity: 0)` instead of `Visibility(visible: false)` where hiding is needed.

## 6. **Use Lazy Loading and Pagination**

* Load data in chunks using `ListView.builder` + scroll controller.

## 7. **Use Efficient State Management**

* Use proper state management (e.g., Bloc, Provider, GetX) to prevent full widget tree rebuilds.

## 8. **Avoid Using Opacity Widget Excessively**

* Prefer `FadeTransition` or `AnimatedOpacity` for animations.

## 9. **Use `RepaintBoundary` for Complex Widgets**

* Wrap animations or frequently updated widgets to isolate repaints.

```dart
RepaintBoundary(
  child: CustomPaint(...),
);
```

## 10. **Defer Work with `SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()`**

* Useful for heavy tasks or API calls after first render.

## 11. **Optimize Build Method**

* Avoid calculations, heavy loops or allocations inside the `build()` method.

## 12. **Preload Assets**

* Use `precacheImage()` or load assets early to avoid UI jank.

## 13. **Reduce Use of SetState()**

* Use state management or `ValueNotifier` for more control.
* Avoid calling `setState` too frequently.

## 14. **Dispose Controllers and Listeners Properly**

* Prevent memory leaks by disposing controllers, streams, animations.

## 15. **Use Isolates for Heavy Computation**

* Dart Isolates run on background threads.

```dart
compute(expensiveFunction, input);
```

## 16. **Compress Images and Media**

* Use optimized image sizes.
* Use formats like WebP instead of PNG/JPEG where supported.

## 17. **Use Flutter DevTools**

* Profile performance, memory, and rendering using DevTools.
* Analyze slow frames and widget rebuilds.

## 18. **Avoid Unnecessary Packages**

* Only use essential dependencies.
* Periodically audit `pubspec.yaml`.

## 19. **Use `flutter build --release` for Production**

* Ensure production build is optimized.

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## 20. **Use Lazy Singleton or Dependency Injection**

* Prevent large classes from initializing too early.
* Use packages like `get_it` or `injectable`.

## Bonus Tips for Teams

* Enforce best practices in code reviews.
* Benchmark regularly during development.
* Educate juniors to recognize costly UI patterns.
* Monitor app performance post-launch using tools like Firebase Performance Monitoring.
